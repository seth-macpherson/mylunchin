== Welcome to MyLunchIn.com

My Lunch In is application that allows local businesses to provide a lunch delivery (or pickup) service easily and affordably.  

The platform is built on Spree Commerce and will be open sourced as a themed extension and a "delivery" extension compatible with Spree v.70+.  

Plans are underway to provide subdomains - mysubshop.mylunchin.com and have the site load the appropriate content (but you didn't hear that from me).
